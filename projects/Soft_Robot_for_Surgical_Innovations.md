My senior capstone project was to work on the research and development of a Soft Robot for minimally invasive surgery within the lung.

I was on a group of ten people and worked as the team's logistics manager and technical expert. As the only person on the team to have any background with soft robotics matter, I helped provide a larger knowledge base and I did what I could to help guide the team.

This additional knowledge that I had was immensely helpful

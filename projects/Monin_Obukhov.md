# [Evaluating Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory](#evaluating-monin-obukhov-similarity-theory)

## Project Background
My internship at the NorthWest Research Associates, focused on analyzing the foundational micrometeorological theory called Monin-Obukhov Simularity theory. This theory was first solidified in 1946, and was expanded upon by Businger et. al. in 1971. The theory is primarily used to describe the non-dimensionalized mean flow of air and it's temperature as a fuctionn of (non-dimesioalized) height in the surface layer of the atmosphere. 

This theory allowed for the analysis of turbulence in the surface layer through a set of "universal" equations. These equations, and the constants used with-in them, where developed over a limited sample size and at a time where high-resolution data collection methods and technologies did not exist. Our goal was to expand upon these data over more varied environments (different landscapes), during different weather events, and over different seasons, with sensors that are more sensitive to change, and capable of higher sampling rates than was possible in 1940's and the 1970's. This was in the hope of verifying the constants used are indeed universal, or to find a more accurate description of the constants used.

My role was to code the software neccesary to process and analyze our collected data for the values we where interested in. My boss, Dr. Andreas Mushinski had been able to create vast data sets spaning several years, and various environments, and my software was needed, in orcer to convert the data collected into a useable form.

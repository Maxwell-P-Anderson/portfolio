# Project Background

  As a memeber of the Boulder High School Robotics team, "The Landsharks", I was apprached by the faculty sponsor of our team, and the theater department, to create a prop for the upcoming production of *Beauty and the Beast*. The theater department wanted a moving prop for the character Maurice's flying machine. If one does not know the plot of *Beauty and the Beast* the main character's father is an inventor. He gets lost in the woods on his way to demonstrate his newest invention, a flying machine. While he is lost, he is eventually captured by the titular Beast, and imprisoned in the beast's estate. The plot is besides the point, the fact of the matter was that the theater department was interested in paying the robotics clubto make for them a realistic looking flying machine that would be shown off in three scenes of the play. My director put me to the task, and I was excited to work solo for the first time on a real technical project.

# Difficulties

 We decided early on in the project to use pneumatics to actuate the wings

# Project Background

In Highschool, I took my first engineering technology class in my junior year after I was a part of the robotics team for the previous two years. In this class, our final project was to create a machine with 15 unique parts, a moving component, and use atleast two different manufacturing methods. I was very fortunate to go to a highschool that had laser cutters, 3D printers, and basic machine tools. During my time with the robotics club, I got enough experience to feel comfortable with the drill press, CNC Router, and jig saw, so I decided to focus on the laser cutting and 3d printing manufacturing methods.

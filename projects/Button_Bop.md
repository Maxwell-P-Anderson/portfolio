# Project Background

 In my freshman year of college, I took a generaly engineering projects class. This class aimed to give students with no experience with any hands on projects the relevant skills to take a projct from start to finish. This included classes and workshops that aimed to teach the basics of Arduino, machining and 3d modeling.
 
With my experience from my high school's robotics class and the "Pneumatic wings" project, I was already ahead of the curve in this knowledge base, with a few years of solidworks under my belt, and training on most of the basic machining processes.

Our final project for this class was given to us by a local elementary school with a program that specially helped kids with autism, and other disabilities. The teachers of this program wished to have a game that would encourge their students to develop their hand eye cordination, as that is often a difficulty for students with these disabilities. Working closely with our client, our team came up with a concept for a game involving big buttons and colorful RGB LED's we titled "Button Bop!"

The goal of the game was to make a game that was both visually and physically engaging to the students with a scoring system to allow teachers to track student progress. We did this by having our board contain a central LCD display that displayed a desired color, with six acryllic plates that would glow a random color. The player would then press the button next to the plate that matched the LCD. 

Here is a video of the game operating and being played:

# Difficulties

Before this project, I knew next to nothing about Aurduino programming, and niether did my team mates. Unfortunately for our team our game would have to implement an aurduino in order to run the game logic, and coordinate the different LED circuits. I decided to step up and learn everything we needed to know to develop this game and became our team's resident programmer. I spent 8 hours a week for 6 weeks in the office hours of the projects consulting engineer who taught the aurdino workshops in order to develop my own skills and develop the logic of our game. It would have been more simple to have set positions for each LED color on the board, but we wanted to randomize the position of the colors each round. This was to better stimulate the students and make it so they had to process more information to excecute the each action.

# Lessons Learned

I had some prior experience working with clients and project goals, but this was my first oppurtunity and deepen these skills and apply them in a long term project. I learned how to ask the right questions to get to the heart of what our client wanted out of this project.

# [About Me](#ab)

Hello, my name is Maxwell Palen Anderson. 

I am a Mechanical Engineering Masters student at the University of Colorado Boulder, who is expecting to graduate in May 2023. I have been developing my engineering knowledge ever since my freshman year of high school when I joined the robotics club. That experience&mdash;and the lessons that it taught me&mdash;sparked a passion for building robotic systems, designing components, and working to solve problems.

As a STEM focused student who loved social studies and the humanities, I have grown into an engineer who is concerned about the human experience and who always considers the end user in mind. In my mind, there is no reason for engineers to do the work we do if no one can use what we make. Engaging in _human-centered engineering_ is how I hope to make an impact and how I wish to give back to my community.

In college (and even in high school), I have worked on many projects that I am proud of. This website serves as an archive of each project and describes why the project was important to me and what I learned from it.

I hope that you enjoy your time here! 

-Max

# [Publications](#pub)

* Co-Author on a paper that has been published in IEEE T-RO. 

  *Sundaram V., Ly K., Johnson B., Naris M., Anderson M., Humbert S., Correll N., and Rentschler M., ["Embedded Magnetic Sensing for Feedback Control of Soft HASEL Actuators"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9882180) in IEEE Transactions on Robotics, 2022.*
  
  I earned the co-authorship on the paper from the work that is described in the two project entries: "Linear Displacement to Magnetic Field Strength Correlation Platform," and "Platform for Calibrating Magnetometers in Dynamic Environments."

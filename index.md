# About Me:

Hello,

My name is Maxwell Palen Anderson, I am a Mechanical Engineering Senior in my final months of my undergraduate degrees. I have been learning and working on my engineeering knowledge ever since my freshaman year in highschool when I joined the robotics club. That experience, and the lessons that it taught me, sparked a passion for building systems, designing components, and working to solve problems.

As a STEM focused student who loved social studies, I have grown into an engineer who is concerned about the human experience, and always keeps the end user in mind. In my mind, there is no reason for engineers to do the work that we do, if nobody is going to be using what we make. Human-centered engineering is how I wish to give back to my community and how I want to leave my inpact.

In my college career I have worked on many projects, struggled through many classes, and done a lot of work that I am very proud of. This website is going to serve as an archive of each and every project that I have worked on, why it was important to me, and what I learned from it. 

I hope that you enjoy your time here!
-Max

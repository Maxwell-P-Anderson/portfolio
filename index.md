# [](#Ab)About Me:

Hello, my name is Maxwell Palen Anderson. 

I am a Mechanical Engineering Senior in my final months of my undergraduate degree. I have been developing my engineering knowledge ever since my freshman year of high school when I joined the robotics club. That experience&mdash;and the lessons that it taught me&mdash;sparked a passion for building robotic systems, designing components, and working to solve problems.

As a STEM focused student who loved social studies and the humanities, I have grown into an engineer who is concerned about the human experience and who always considers the end user in mind. In my mind, there is no reason for engineers to do the work that we do, if no one can use what we make. Human-centered engineering is how I hope to make an impact and how I wish to give back to my community.

In college, I have worked on many projects and I am proud of what I have achieved after investing a lot of time and effort in each of them. This website serves as an archive of each project and describes why the project was important to me and what I learned from it. 

I hope that you enjoy your time here! 

-Max

| Project Title | Brief Project Description | Project Time Span |
|:-------------:|:--------------------------|:--------------:|
|[Soft Robot for Surgical Innovations](./projects/Soft_Robot_for_Surgical_Innovations.html)| For my senior design project, my team and I worked for three clients from Medtronic to learn about the current state of soft robotics, and develop our own soft robot for future use in bronchoscopy| 2021 - 2022 |
| <a class="wip" href="#"> Evaluating Monin-Obukhov Simularity Theory <img src="Underconstruction2.png" width="200" height="200" alt="WIP"> </a> | Developed Matlab scripts and functions to calculate the statistics required to evaluate Monin-Obukhov Simularity Theory from years worth of collected atmospheric data.| 2021 - 2022 |
|<a class="wip" href="#"> Autonomous Robot that plays "Rocket League" <img src="Underconstruction2.png" alt="WIP"> </a>| My team and I created an autonomous robot to play a game of "Rocket Leage" against other autonomus robots.| 2021 |
|<a class="wip" href="#"> Linear Discplacement to Magnetic field strength Correlation Platform <img src="Underconstruction2.png" alt="WIP"> </a>| Designed, manufactured, asseblemed and used a novel platform to gathering data used to correlate the linear displacement of a new soft robotic actuator to a magnetic field strength.| 2020 - 2021 |
|<a class="wip" href="#"> Dynamic Statue - Marble Machine <img src="Underconstruction2.png" alt="WIP"> </a>| For my component design class, my team and I designed and fabricated a marble machine that utalized a CAM driven escalator.| 2021 |
